Terraform scripts to build server for Minecraft

Ansible scripts to initialize and create servers for Minecraft

1. EBS volume for each server and how to do it (does running from EBS have lag?)
1. Might be easier to use server manager and just copy backups manually
1. Need to create hosts file from terraform output
